This project is about creating a coffee machine using the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The goal is to make the machine work in a way that feels real, where it can take money, check ingredients, and prepare coffee.

The menu will be created in a separate file. This menu contains different coffee types along with their prices. By keeping the menu in a separate file, the project becomes cleaner and easier to manage.

The coffee machine will only work if both the ingredients and the money are available. If any ingredient is missing, the machine will display a message like “Ingredient not available.” If the money inserted is less than the required amount, the machine will show a message like “Need more money.” Only when both the money and the ingredients are enough will the machine prepare the selected coffee.

OOP concepts are used to design this project. Classes and objects are used to create the machine, the menu, and money handling. Encapsulation is used to keep the details of ingredients, money, and menu inside their own classes. Abstraction allows the user to simply choose a drink without worrying about the process happening inside. Finally, the separation of concerns is shown by keeping the menu in a separate file from the machine code.
